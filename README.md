Here I save a simple Python code created by me in order to satisfy the academic need of plotting experimental data in a "right way" as a physicist.

This program is made with the main focuses of:
- Representing experimental data (discrete)
- Representing analytical theorical expressions ("continuous")
- Making linear regressions with it's respective slpe, intersection and R^2
- Most important: Adjusting at one's will the X and Y limits of the axes, the scale, the format of the numbers on the ticks, the number of ticks, it's direction...
